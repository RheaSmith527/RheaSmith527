I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional powering my way through a rigorous
educational program to help me get my footing in this field. I love getting the 
opportunity to learn more about Linux, different Log and Packet readers, as well
as different possible social engineering attacks. I have developed myself 
throughout my career in different food service, managerial roles, and my time
at a renowned research university. My time as a lead caterer helped me develop
an awarness of balancing what a customer states that they need and what exactly
that requires on the back end. My time as an assistant manager for Domino's has
pushed me to develop my capablity to split up tasks into smaller goals and how
to delegate those goals effectively and efficiently. Being surrounded by genius
young adults all passionate about research has driven in me a desire to not only
grow my own knowledge but how to use that drive to assist others in ways they may not
know they need just yet. I am incredibly excited to work towards developing new 
and innovative methods to combat social engineering! I feel it's an area where
people are more vulnerable than we may expect. But for me to get to that point
I need to take that first step in to the industry so that within the next
5-10 years I may just be able to stand on equal footing to those ingenious giants
that have paved our way.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, looking to get my start in IT then aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
